# Retrofit
This is just a simple App for getting data using retrofit and persisiting state using ViewModel. It also shows how to use Glide. Do not forget to get your own API Key and adding the necessary dependencies and internet permissions. 
In addition, I use lifecycle components to make sure that configuration does not trigger unnecessary network calls.
Keep in mind that I am using androidx as well. In addition, this code follows the MVVM design pattern.
Happy coding!!
